					<h1>Privacy</h1>
				<p>
				›› &nbsp;Effective October 22, 2015
				<br/><br/>
				
				Our privacy policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Station-App, Inc. ("Station") when you use our mobile application ("App"), our website ("Site"), and other online products and services that link to this privacy policy (collectively, the "Service").</p>

				<p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our <Link to="Terms" style={branded}>Terms of Service</Link>.</p>
				
				<h5>Generally</h5>

				<p>Simply put, your privacy is our top priority.  We take all reasonable measures (and many that might be considered extreme) to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  In fact, we start protecting your privacy the minute you start using the Service by refusing to even take your email, phone number, or any other personal information when you start using Station.</p>
				
				<p>When you start using Station, we uniquely identify your mobile device in a secure fashion. This secure device id is then used to interact and establish your account on the Station Platform.</p>
				
				<p>So what that means is, not only will your content not be traceable back to you (either by us or another user), we wouldn't know who you were anyway.  We simply avoid being in the position where we could ever reveal the identity of our Service users by never knowing their identities.  The only way we would ever obtain either your mobile number or email address is if you insisted on establishing a username and password. The email address or mobile number would only be used as a recovery method for a lost password or resetting of your password.  Again though, unless you opt in, we will never possess any means of identifying you, providing you with total privacy.</p>
				
				<p>Further, we don't sell our users' information.  The data we automatically collect when you use the Service is solely used by us for debugging and analytical purposes.  We do not collect your information in order to sell it to advertisers.  And we never take control of information you broadcast on your station.  What this means is that when you are using the Service and you delete content you were broadcasting on your station, to protect your privacy and anonymity, that information cannot be restored.</p>
				
				<h5>A Warning About Ephemeral Content</h5>
				<p>Anonymity is great, and being able to control the lifespan of your content posted on the Service is also great.  However, we would like to caution you up front regarding certain actions other users may take that are out of Station's control and which could change your ephemeral content into permanent content.  Some examples include, but are not limited to:  (i) various third-party apps exist that may allow users to save your content; (ii) some users may employ simple workarounds that allow them to take screenshots of your content without detection; and, of course (iii) there are always those old-school users who might take a photograph of your content with their smartphones to preserve it.  Just remember that despite our best efforts, there is simply no way we can guarantee that your ephemeral content posted to your (or any other user's) station will "disappear forever."</p>
				
				<h5>Modifications</h5>
				<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an in-app notification).  We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
				
				<h5>Collection of Information</h5><br />
				<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br/>
				We collect information you provide directly to us - including, for example, when you sign up for our Service, fill out a form, make a broadcast ("Broadcast") on the Station App, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. We make it a point NOT to collect personal information such as your email, phone number, contacts, etc.  However, Station will collect your geolocation information in order to show you stations located near you.  To learn more about limiting the sharing of your geolocation data, please see "Your Choices" below.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Service</strong><br/>
				When you access or use our Service, we automatically collect information about you.  This information is solely used by us for debugging and analytical purposes (e.g., to enhance the Service), and it includes:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Device Information:</strong>  We collect information about the mobile device you use to access our Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.</li>
						<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may also collect information about the location of your device each time you access or use one of our mobile applications or otherwise consent to the collection of this information.  Details are provided below under "Your Choices."</li>
					</ol>
				
				<h5>Use of Information</h5>
				<p>We may use information about you for various purposes, including to:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Provide, maintain and improve our Service;</li>
						<li>Provide and deliver the Service you request, process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations;</li>
						<li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;</li>
						<li>Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;</li>
						<li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events offered by Station and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;</li>
						<li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Service;</li>
						<li>Personalize and improve the Service and provide advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests; and</li>
						<li>Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service.</li>
					</ol>
				
				<h5>Storage of Information</h5>
				<p>The information you provide to Station is stored on Google servers.  Your information is stored only as long as necessary to accomplish the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  We store log information collected for debugging purposes in approximately seven-day temporary storage.  We store other information you provide to us (such as an email or phone number should you choose to establish an optional username and password to access the Service from your device) for as long as you maintain an account with Station.  You may delete your account at any time.  When you delete your account, your information will be deleted from our system within thirty days.  Please be aware that Google has its own data backup and retention policy, so while we will not have access to your information for more than thirty days after you delete your account, we have no control over how long Google may take to wipe your data from its servers.</p>
				
				<h5>Sharing of Information</h5>
				<p>We may share <u>aggregated or de-identified information</u> about you as follows or as otherwise described in this privacy policy:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>With other users of the Service based on a user's access to a station;</li>
						<li>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf; and</li>
						<li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Station assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another Station.</li>
					</ol>
				
				<p>We may share specific information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this privacy policy:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;</li>
						<li>If the content of a Broadcast can reasonably be considered illegal or unlawful (or it seems like the Broadcast is being used to engage in, encourage or promote such activities), in which case we may report any information available to us to proper authorities in order to protect the rights, property and safety of Station, our users and/or others; and</li>
						<li>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information</li>
					</ol>
				
				<p><strong>Finally, please note that if you choose to share a Broadcast or any other information with a third party, such as Facebook, Twitter, or an email client, the collection and sharing of that information will be governed by that third party's privacy policy.  We have no control over the actions of such third parties.</strong></p>
				
				<h5>How We Respond to Subpoenas from Courts</h5>
				<p>We have taken great effort to build strong security and encryption architecture to keep your Broadcasts completely anonymous.  While we make every effort NOT to come into possession of your personally identifying data, if you have chosen to provide us with your email address, phone number or other personal data, we may be compelled by a court disclose it.  In the event that we are so compelled, we will make every effort to contact you before we disclose any such personal information to give you time to fight the subpoena in court.  Under the laws of the United States, an argument could be made under the Constitution that the subpoena violates your First Amendment right to speak anonymously.  Please consult with your attorney regarding such matters.</p>
				
				<h5>International Users</h5>
				<p>Station is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law.  By accessing or using the Service or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries.</p>
				
				<p>Station-App, Inc. participates in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program, and strictly adheres to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.  For more information about the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program, visit the Department of Commerce's U.S.-EU Safe Harbor page.</p>
				
				<h5>Children's Information</h5>
				<p>Station does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from any individual under the age of thirteen without parental or guardian consent.  We do not direct any of our business practices or system outputs towards children under the age of thirteen.</p>
				
				<p>If we are notified or have any other reason to believe that we have collected personal information from or about a child under the age of thirteen, Station will promptly delete the information and any account associated with that information.</p>
				<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen and you believe Station has information from or about your child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@stationlocal.com">legal@stationlocal.com</a></p>
				
				<h5>Security</h5>
				<p>Security is extremely important to us.  We take all reasonable measures to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, including industry standard security and encryption features, and limits as to who at Station may access your personal information (should you provide us any).</p>
				
				<p>Email addresses and phone numbers (if provided and/or created) are all hashed (with shared salt) prior to storage. Our employees can only access email and phone number lists by logging into our proprietary moderation tool, which features a two-factor authentication system. These employees are also not able to find Broadcasts created by a specific user.  While it is necessary for our system to maintain a link between the Broadcasts you submit and your user account information (so we can let you know when your Broadcast receives comments, feedback or other activity), it is intentionally difficult for us to ever discover that link. </p>
				<p>No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.  If you notice a bug or vulnerability that could lead to the deanonymization of user data on Station, please let us know by submitting bugs to <a href="mailto:bugs@stationlocal.com">bugs@stationlocal.com</a>. In the unlikely event that your personal information is compromised due to a data breach, we will take all reasonable steps to remedy the breach and notify you as soon as possible.</p>
				
				<h5>Your Choices</h5><br/>
				<p><u>Account Information</u><br/>
				If you want to review your account information, please visit "Settings" gear icon within the App. </p>
				
				<p><u>Deleting Your Account</u><br/>
				If you wish to delete your account or individual Broadcasts, visit our FAQ page and follow the instructions there.  When you delete your entire account, all your Broadcasts associated with your account will be permanently deleted.  Your Broadcasts will be immediately removed from all visible streams, so no other user will be able to see your Broadcasts.  For further details, see "Storage of Information" above.</p>
				
				<p>Please note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. </p> 
				
				<p><u>Geolocation information</u><br/>
				You can restrict Station's collection of geolocation information by changing your phone's privacy settings.  On iPhone, go to Settings > Privacy > Location, and switch Station to "Off." </p>
				
				<p><u>Android Location Settings</u><br/>
				To change your location settings for Google apps, follow these steps:
					<ol>
						<li>Open Google Settings from your device's apps menu.</li>
						<li>Touch the box next to <strong>Access location</strong>. The setting turns off when the checkmark disappears.</li>
						<li><strong>To turn this setting back on</strong>, simply touch the box next to <strong>Access location</strong> until a checkmark appears.</li>
					</ol>
				<u>Cookies</u><br/></p>
				
				<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.  If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies.  Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies used in connection with our Service. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Service.</p>
				
				<p><u>"Do Not Track" Instructions</u><br/>
				The Site does not respond to Do Not Track instructions from browsers, but instead automatically collects log file and cookie information from all users who visit the Site.</p>
				
				<p><u>Push Notifications/Alerts</u><br/>
				Station may send push notifications or alerts to your device.  You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your device (iOS) or by changing your settings within our Service (Android).</p>
